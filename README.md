## Reflection

This was fun, yet challenging project - considering it has been a couple months since I've used Ruby/Rails. 

It started off to a rocky start - firstly, when installing the environent for ruby v3, and consquently rails v7 - but alas, I won.

I fullfilled each of the requirements listed, while keeping the data & overall layout fairly simple. I've used a mobile first approach with regards to responsiveness, and then catered to iPad & Laptop screen size at my discretion. I mostly used scss (and vanilla css), with the exception of the 'simple_form' gem which makes use of bootstrap. 

I would have liked to have done some more testing, since this was also a new aspect in rails that I had not done before. But I did test for general CRUD.

Thank you,
